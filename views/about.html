                    <h2>RedC Philosophy</h2>
                    <p>As I have done more and more research into the area of submersible technology, I have come to the conclusion that the technology market is on the brink of an "underwater revolution." The untapped potential of Earth's bodies of water is starting to come to light. Based on the idea that "data centers love remote, cold environments," Microsoft has recently been testing just that. It is even possible to have an underwater turbine power this data center. On another note National Geographic reports that, "the deep sea contains enough mineable gold that there's nine pounds (four kilograms) of it for every person on Earth." So why haven't projects like this been carried out to a greater extent yet? In my opinion, it is because we lack the tools and methodology needed to safely, successfully, and consistently bring technology underwater. What my team is doing is making an imperative tool that will be of paramount importance to any underwater project, venture, or exploration. Not only are we creating the tool, but we are attempting to do so in a modular and efficient way such that this technology can be available and of use to any underwater project. Along with this, we are developing new and innovative ways of integrating water with technology. The technology we are creating will be deeply integrated in the ventures of the future.

                    <h2>About our team</h2>
                    <p> RedC robotics is a student run organization at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign dedicated to creating remotely operated underwater vehicles. Members are given the oppurtunity to work in a laboratory environment, experiment with ongoing university research, and refine their technical skills.</p>

                    <p>The redC team is working alongside researchers at the Ven Te Chow Hydrosystems Laboratory where robots we are building will assist with current studies. These robots combine a large variety of skills from designing the robot in CAD to programming the logic behind the controls on a custom built circuit board. Currently, the robot is drafted using Autodesk Inventor, circuits are designed using CadSoft Eagle, and software is running on Debian Linux with a mix of C# and Python for robot controls. With access to university resources such as 3D printing workspaces, fabrication labs, and world class professors, redC robotics ensures that the quality of the robots are top tier.
